## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the FastAPI Application**
   Ensure your FastAPI application is running. You can start it using:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   Replace `app.main:app` with the appropriate module path if necessary.

3. **Run Cypress Tests**
   To open the Cypress Test Runner, run:
   ```
   npx cypress open
   ```
   This will launch the Cypress interface where you can select and run your tests.

4. **Running Tests Headlessly**
   To run tests in headless mode, use:
   ```
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Writing Tests
You can add your test cases in the `cypress/integration/app.spec.js` file. Use the provided fixtures in `cypress/fixtures/example.json` to mock API responses as needed.

## Custom Commands
If you need to create reusable commands, define them in `cypress/support/commands.js`.

## Plugins
For any custom Cypress plugins, configure them in `cypress/plugins/index.js`.

## Configuration
Adjust the Cypress settings in the `cypress.json` file according to your testing needs.
